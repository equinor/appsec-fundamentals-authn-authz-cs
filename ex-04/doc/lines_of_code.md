# Lines of Code - Dependency Scanning (ü•∏)

In this section we will explore some of the impact using open source frameworks and modules has on our project.

## --Code Analysis--

Counting lines of JavaScript code in project, my own code and code in modules/frameworks.</br>(We have used **cloc** to do the counting)

| Part | EX-2 | EX-4 |
| ---  | ---  | ---  |
| Exercise JS LOC   | 797  |  838 |
| Modules JS LOC   | 1.519.329  | 1.525.575  |
| % own code | 0.052% | 0.054% |
| Direct Node Modules | 16 | 16 |
| Indirect Node Modules | 363 | 391 |

Steps:

You will use the command line for the next steps
* Stop the application if it's running, navigate to the `./ex-04` directory
* Remove installed dependencies

    ```shell
    rm -r node_modules
    ```

* Use CLOC to analyse code, observe technologies in use, lines of code etc.

    ```shell
    cloc .
    ```

* Install dependencies

    ```shell
    npm ci
    ```

* Use CLOC to analyse code, observe technologies in use, lines of code etc.

    ```shell
    cloc .
    ```

## --Now You--

* Do the steps

## --Dependency scanning--

The patterns shown above is not unique to the JavaScript environment - it is more or less how it is these days. From a security perspective we should be able analyses issues in our own code - but what about the 99.9% of the code we have not written ourselves?

This is where open source dependency scanning could make a difference. In Equinor we use [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to scan open source dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Scanning of source code is mandatory in Equinor. Read more about Snyk at [appsec.equinor.com](https://appsec.equinor.com/snyk/) ‚ö°Ô∏è

Snyk provide:

* Open source dependency vulnerability scanning
* Open source license issues
* Vulnerability scanning of container images
* Static code analysis
* Scanning for vulnerabilities in infrastructure as code files
* The Snyk vulnerability database
* The Snyk advisor (providing detailed intel on dependencies and projects)
