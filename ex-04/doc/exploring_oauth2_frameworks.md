# Exploring OAuth2 frameworks

The purpose of this section is to list and perhaps discuss a few frameworks for OAuth2.

## --Frameworks--

* Explore the **QuickStart** section in Microsoft Entra ID App Registrations for your application
* Explore [Microsoft Identity Platform Authentication Libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-v2-libraries)
* Explore [Authentication Libraries](https://oauth.net/code/) at [oauth.net](https://oauth.net/)
* Explore the [Microsoft Entra ID Quick Starts](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts) and [Azure-Samples](https://github.com/orgs/Azure-Samples/repositories?language=&page=1&q=ms-identity&sort=&type=all) organization on Github.

## --Now You--

* Spend a few minutes browsing and make yourself familiar with the resources
* Drop a message on the course slack channel state which authentication library you are using today (if any)
  
## --Discuss security issues and good practices--

* Is it a good practice to always use the latest version of Microsoft MSAL - as long as Microsoft Entra ID is our main identity provider?
  * Pros & Cons.
