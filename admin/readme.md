Appsec Fundamentals - AuthN & AuthZ, new workshop is coming up! 

We are preparing for a new run of the AuthN and AuthZ workshop.

The workshop is a hands-on experience where we explore protecting API's and Web apps, all in an Equinor Context. This is AppSec fundamental topics revolving around Authentication (AuthN) and Authorization (AuthZ). In the workshop participants will get to know key technologies such as OAuth2, OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Microsoft Entra ID. Our journey will take us from specification, to manual flow inspection, to coding, to using frameworks, to debugging and to testing - all for relevant Equinor scenarios. After the workshop the participants should have a pretty good understanding of the mechanics behind the scenes, good ideas on how to test without turning off authentication and authorization features, and not the least - how to debug and observe what happening on the wire.
 
Throughout the workshop we will discuss security issues, good practices and share experiences between the participants. This last part may be the most important one.
 
- This is a technical hands-on workshop
- The workshop technical level is intermediate/advanced
- The workshop covers a lot of ground, the pace is usually perceived as high
- The workshop will be organized as 2-day event
- We recommend that teams sing-up multiple participants. 
- Participant must be able to join both days.
- Maximum number of participants for each workshop is XX

The workshop lives in the [appsec-fundamentals-authn-authz]-cs(https://github.com/equinor/appsec-fundamentals-authn-authz-cs) repo on Github. Head over to the repo to get a better idea for content, exercises and preparations.
