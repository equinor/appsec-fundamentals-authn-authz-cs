Appsec Fundamentals - AuthN & AuthZ - The CS edition, new workshop is coming up! 

We are preparing for a new run of the AuthN and AuthZ workshop.

In the workshop participant will get to know key technologies such as OAuth2, OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Microsoft Entra ID. Our journey will take us from the rfc specifications, to manual request, to coding, to using frameworks, to debugging and to testing. After the workshop participants should have a pretty good understanding of the mechanics behind the scenes as well as relevant security/privacy concerns

The is the CS version of the A&A workshop. It's adapted to a 2 day course, using Github Codespaces. The scope is reduced, so is the requirements for preparations to your local developer environment. Everything happens in the cloud.

Throughout the workshop we will discuss security issues, good practices and share experiences between the participants. This last part may be the most important one.
 
- This is a technical hands-on workshop
- The workshop technical level is intermediate/advanced
- The workshop covers a lot of ground, the pace is usually perceived as high
- The workshop will be organized as 2-day event
- We recommend that teams sing-up multiple participants. 
- Participant must be able to join both days.
- Maximum number of participants for each workshop is XX

The workshop lives in the [appsec-fundamentals-authn-authz-cs](https://github.com/equinor/appsec-fundamentals-authn-authz-cs) repo on Github. Head over to the repo to get a better idea for content, exercises and preparations.
