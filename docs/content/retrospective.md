# Workshop Retrospective

---

## Setting the stage

We have been together 2 days exploring protecting api's and web apps. Along the road we have discussed good practices, security and testing.

Our objective was to "de-mystify, build confidence and prepare for further exploration of A&A"

In this short retrospective we will try to identify negative and positive components of the workshop. We will use this information to enhance the workshop for the next group.

Sharing is caring!

## Gathering data - the 4L's

We will divide into groups. Each group is invited to discuss/share/reflect on the following topics:

* Liked
* Learned
* Lacked
* Longed for
   
The person in the group with the next upcoming birthday is awarded the key role as THE group facilitator. This role will on behalf of the group summarize up to 3 points for each of the L's. This will be in written format and will be shared with the other groups.  <!-- .element style="font-size: 0.80em"-->

Group work will be time-boxed to 12 minutes.
