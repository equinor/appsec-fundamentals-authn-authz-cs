# Exploring the app code

In this part we will explore the app and the code to get an idea of the moving parts and how they work together.

Steps:

* Explore the [Microsoft Entra ID end-points](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/RegisteredApps) once again
* Explore the app config (./lib/app-config.js)
* Explore the server & web app end-points (./src/server.js, ./src/app.js)
* Explore html templating (./public, ./view)
* Explore the authentication code (./lib/auth-utils.js)
* Explore the tests

## --Now You--

* Do the steps and make yourself familiar with the structure of the code
* One of the tests is failing. The title of html for the initial web page contain a typo, it should be "A-and-A FTW"
  * Correct the typo
  * Ensure all tests pass
* When done - it's a good time to hydrate and the offer your help to fellow participants.
