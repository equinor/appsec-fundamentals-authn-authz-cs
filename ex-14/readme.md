# EX-14 Integration testing

In this exercise we will explore testing in the context of A&A. Some questions that we will explore will be:

* What is testing?
* What is the connection between architecture and testability?
* When are mocks and stubs becoming a problem?
* Where do we spend our "test money"?
* What could be important test principles?
* How to test applications without turning off A&A or security features?
