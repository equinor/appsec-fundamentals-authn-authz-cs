Welcome to the AppSec Fundamentals AuthN & AuthZ Workshop - The CS Version

** Please note **

- Using two screens during the workshop has proven to provide a good set-up for most participants
- If the workshop is a virtual one, keeping your camera on will increase the quality for both instructors and participants
- Be curious - ask questions
- You learn when you explore stuff you don't know!
- Make sure you're here with us, not on your phone or doing parallel work
- Work with us to make this a space where everyone feels respected and trusted
