# Running the client and the api

In this part we will execute the apps for the client and the episodes api. Remember that both components needs to be executed in their separate terminal windows.


## The Episodes Api

Steps:

(Assuming you are in a terminal window at ./ex-10/got-episodes-api)
  
* Source the configuration file

    ```shell
    source ~/path-to-env-file/appsec-course-api-episodes-eq.env 
    ```

* Run the application 

    ```shell
    npm start 
    ```

* Verify that the application is running by:
  * Open the browser for the url that serves forwarded port 3100
  * Test the **/doc** end point

### --Now You--

* Do the steps above
* Play around with the Swagger interface, it may not work 100% ðŸ˜€


## The Client


Steps:

(Assuming you are in a terminal window at ./ex-10/client)
  
* Source the configuration file

    ```shell
    source ~/path-to-env-file/appsec-course-client-eq.env
    ```

* Run the application
  
    ```shell
    NODE_ENV=development npm start 
    ```

* You may have to fix an error before the application will start
* Use the application from your browser

### --Now You--

* Do the steps above
* Log in and use the "Show Got Episodes" functionality
* Observe how the two components interacts (via logs in the terminal windows)

### -- Add-on -- (if time)

* We will use the Swagger interface to work with the API
* The Swagger Base URL will support a dynamic environment like Codespaces
* Define the environment variable `SWAGGER_HOST` by running the command before starting the API
* Stop the Episodes API
* Set the SWAGGER_HOST value

  ```shell
  export SWAGGER_HOST=$(echo $CODESPACE_NAME'-'$PORT'.'$GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN)
  ```
* Start the Episodes API, access Swagger at the /doc endpoint
* Extract an access token from the client and use it to get episode #2 utilizing the Episodes API's Swagger interface. Remember `Bearer` in front of the Access Token in Authorization
* Extract an access token from the client and use it to delete episode #3 utilizing the Episodes API's Swagger interface (Hints, define scope, assign permissions on scope, request scope)
  

## User consent, rather than client authorization

Let's experiment wih user consent, rather than authorizing a client for a scope.

Steps:

* For the Episodes api, remove the client authorization for scope **Episodes.Read**, save.
* Stop the client, delete the token cache, start the **Client**, login, select "Show GOT Episodes", observe the error.
* "Copy" the full scope uri for **Episodes.Read** (api://...../episodes.read) from the episodes app registration.
* Add this scope to the client's login request
  * './lib/app-config', msalConfig.request.authCodeUrlParameters.scopes: []'
  * Stop the client, delete the token cache and Start the client
  * Activate the "Application Developer" role in Azure PIM.
  * Login and recognize the additional consent request for **episodes.read**
  * Select "Show GOT Episodes" and verify that it works.
  * Observe the user consent in the clients permission (Enterprise Application, Permissions, User Consent)

### --Now You--

* Do the steps above
* Revert back to client authorization for the **episodes.read** scope, revoke user consent, delete token cache, verify new set-up.

## Saving config outside the temporal Codespace

You now have updated config for your development environment. The configuration files are living in `$HOME/envs`. Now is a good time to store these in the Codespaces User Secret.

Steps:

* Store configuration in Codespaces User Secrets
  ```shell
  aa-save-env-files-to-github-user-secret.sh
  ```
* (You may want to select "Reload to apply" - but it's not needed at this stage)

## --Discuss security issues and good practices--

* There are multiple ways of *triggering* the user consent flow. We did it during the login phase. It can be done using scripts, api, manual "login" url's etc.
* Questions: Can an access token contain multiple audiences in the jwt token? Yes, according to the spec multiple audiences can be used. However, Microsoft Entra ID is [per-resource-per-scope](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/resources-and-scopes.md) for access tokens; so when using Microsoft Entra ID an access token can only have one audience. The practical consequence of this is that you will have to request a separate access token for each resource (protected resource)
* There is an alternative way of chaining api's like we have started to do now, the [On-Behalf-Of](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) flow in the MS Identity platform. We'll dive into this in a later exercise.
* In many cases we would like to use "sender-constrained" access tokens, that's access tokens that are bound to a specific client [OAuth Security Topic, 2.2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#section-2.2.1). This is currently not available in Microsoft Entra ID. This will be important moving forward!
* Good practice: Embed the [Equinor API Strategy](https://github.com/equinor/api-strategy), the [Rest API Guidelines](https://github.com/equinor/api-strategy/blob/master/docs/rest_guidelines.md) and the [Api Security](https://github.com/equinor/api-strategy/blob/master/docs/strategy.md#api-security) part of the strategy into your teams work.
