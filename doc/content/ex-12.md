## Exercise 12

## Device Code Grant

OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant

---

# Device Code Grant

The Device Code Grant is defined by<br/> [RFC 8628 - OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628)

Abstract

>The OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant is designed for Internet-
connected devices that either lack a browser to perform a user-agent-
based authorization or are input constrained to the extent that
requiring the user to input text in order to authenticate during the
authorization flow is impractical.  It enables OAuth clients on such
devices (like smart TVs, media consoles, digital picture frames, and
printers) to obtain user authorization to access protected resources
by using a user agent on a separate device.<!-- .element style="font-size:0.7em"-->

As developers we often meet this flow in CLI's<br/> (Command Line Interfaces)

>The purpose of this exercise is to explore the Device Code Grant. This grant is designed for devices that lacks a browser for doing authorization..
