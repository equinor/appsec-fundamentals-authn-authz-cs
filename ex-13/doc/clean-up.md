# Clean-up

We have now spent a bit of energy to prepare our development environment for debugging network traffic. This includes putting our environment in a vulnerable state. 


Steps:

* Remove the self generated CA cert
  * from machine?
  * from browsers trust store?
* Remove any data persisted from ZAP?
* Are any "debug" code moving into production?
* Spend a few minutes and threat-model this exercise
  * What could possibly go wrong?
  
## --Now You--

* Consider doing the steps above
* Discuss threats and mitigation with the group.
