# Exploring changes to the app code

In this part we will explore the app and the code to get an idea of the moving parts and how they work together.

## Changes

* We have introduced **session management**.
* We are using the **silent log-in** functionality of MSAL. Previously when we wanted to read the inbox our app acquired an access token for each request to the MS Graph Api. Now our app is doing a lookup into the token cache, if the user is identified (using the session) and has a valid token for the scope that is requested - the existing token will be used (hence - no trip to Microsoft Entra ID to acquire a token for each request). If a valid token does not exist - MSAL will get this, store it in the token cache - and the use it.
* Sessions are stored "in-memory" at the client. The token cache for a "user" is stored in the session.
* We are **protecting end-points**. Only authenticated users can access /showinbox
* We have enhanced the /logout logic. It will remove the signed-in user from the token cache and destroy the app session.

## Exploring code changes (from ex-4)

Steps:

* Observe highlights in changes to the code (ex-04 vs. ex-05)
  </br>(Optional - Diff using VSCode)

  ```shell
  ./bin/src-diff.sh
  ```

* App config (./lib/app-config.js)
  * Adding scope for **silentRequest** into the MSAL config
* Web app (./src/app.js)
  * Adding support for cookies and sessions (for Fastify)
  * Using random key to encrypt cookie (this is not scalable but is ok for our purpose)
  * Using memory store for sessions (this is not scalable but is ok for our purpose)
  * Adding **isAuthenticated** which can be used to restrict access to end-points
  * Adding logic to login/logout of app (dependent on status of session)
  * /showinbox now uses getTokenSilently
* Html templating (./public, ./view)
  * Using the session status to relevant information (login, logout)
* Explore the authentication code (./lib/auth-utils.js) 
  * Logic to connect session to the token cache (storing homeAccountID in session)
  * Logic to update cache/session when user selects logout 
  * Function to get access token silently (using MSAL)
* Application tests
  * Increase mocks/stubs for session, cache and getting tokens silently
  * For auth-utils we now have more test code than functional code ....

## --Now You--

* Investigate the changes
* Identify the two different mechanisms that are used to protect end-points.

## --A note on SameSite attribute for the sessionId cookie--

* We use the _sessionId_ cookie to manage state between the end-user session and the back-end.
* We are using the [_SameSite_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite) attribute to only allow the cookie to be sent to a first-party or same site context. (Security, avoid CSRF )
* Browser handles the _SameSite_ attribute a bit differently - if not set explicitly
  * FireFox will from [v96](https://www.ghacks.net/2022/01/11/mozilla-firefox-96-0-release-here-is-what-is-new/) default to "Lax" as default if not specified.
  * Chrome is currently accepting _no value_ for the _SameSite_ attribute
* For OIDC based _redirect flows_ using POST (responseMode=form_post); "SameSite=Lax" will stop the browser redirect from sending the sessionId cookie to the server/back-end. This means that server will think this is a new session and create a new session object.
* For OIDC based _redirect flows_ using GET (responseMode=query); "SameSite=Lax" will NOT stop the browser redirect from sending the sessionId cookie to the server/back-end. 
* Using "POST" based redirect is default in OIDC
* Using "POST" based redirect in OIDC could introduce issues if you start using the session object prior to logging in (like we will do in ex-9 with PKCE)
  
## --Discuss security issues and good practices--

* Discuss the two different approaches to protecting end-point.
* Good practice: Secure defaults = all end-points are protected by default, explicit open for those which should be open.
* Discuss the importance of logging out of applications
  * From a end-user perspective
  * From the app operations perspective
* Discuss testability of the usage of framework increases
  * Execute the tests from `./ex-02` and `./ex-04`and compare coverage

    ```shell
    npx tap report
    ```
